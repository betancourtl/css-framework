I think that a variable based approach would be better because you can scope
specific components to listen to the variables that you want and react
 accordingly. When I mean react accordingly i mean that you can apply changes
 to a component if you decide to listen to the changes if not then the css
 component will stay the same

 A requirement for this is having DEFINED!! components that have a top most
 css class that can identify and SCOPE this group of elements into their own
 html group of code.
